//! Drawing a [`View`] into a buffer, and nothing else.
//!
//! Pure: same view, same theme, same area, same cells. That is what makes the
//! snapshot suite worth anything, and it is why the frame path, the scroll
//! arithmetic and the terminal all live somewhere else.
//!
//! **No borders, no boxes.** `btop` frames everything, and `btop` has the whole
//! screen. Half a laptop screen beside an agent is the case I6 names, and a box
//! spends two of forty columns and two of twenty-four rows on decoration. Every
//! cell here goes to the diff or to the chrome: one line at the top, and one at
//! the bottom that takes a second only when forty columns cannot hold it.
//!
//! Content is written cell by cell rather than through the widget set. A
//! `Paragraph` would wrap, and wrapping is the one thing a monitor must not do:
//! a wrapped diff line moves every line below it, so the shape of the screen
//! stops meaning anything. Lines are clipped instead.
//!
//! ## I6, which is the whole of the layout
//!
//! `SPEC.md` §11.1 states the rule this module implements: **a thing made of
//! items breaks, a thing made of characters marks its edge, and content is
//! neither.**
//!
//! The hint bar is the only thing on screen made of items, so it is the only
//! thing that breaks — onto [`Footer`]'s second line, and then by dropping whole
//! rungs of [`HINT_RUNGS`]. Everything else is one token and says which end it
//! lost: [`ELIDED`] on the left for a file path, whose tail names the file, and
//! [`CONTINUES`] on the right for everything else, content included.
